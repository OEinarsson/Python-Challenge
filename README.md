# Python-Challenge

there are two main files Pybank and Pypoll that have the main script files and the output files they create.

bank_script.py
this file reads the resource file and outputs the total proft, average change, greatest increase, and greatest decrease. it accomplishes this by looping through the entire file, saving variable, and computing/utilizing some variables at the same time.

poll_script.py
this file uses a dictionary and loops to save and compute the results of an election. it also outputs the winner of the election in a seperate file.


lessons learned:
1. for the next reader comments are really helpful, ensuring you leave some that explain chunks of the code can help
2. spacing helps you read the code
3. utilize specific variable names to make the code easier to debug, and easier for the next person to read

resources used: for troubleshooting I utilized a mixture of google, stackoverflow, and chatGPT
